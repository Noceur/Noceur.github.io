    <p>
        I enjoyed working on this project - I wish I had more time to make
        it more complete. Hopefully I will at some point, as it would be fun to further explore procedural creation of
        parts of the model. While I feel that I have the technical skills required to
        produce assets, I can see that I am out of practice - especially when it comes to texturing, where things have
        come a long way in just a few
        years. This project has given me plenty of room to learn some of it.

                Right away I decided that I wanted to use a modular system, using as few base pieces as possible
                (i.e. planks and beams) and then modifying those. I sclulpted these in zbrush (see image below)
                but in retrospect they could have been made entirely in maya with a bit more effort added in substance painter.<br>For some
                variation in the walls I created a longer texture with several imperfections in it and simply moved
                the UVs of the wall pieces to where I wanted them. I hid the seams with wooden
                details (see video below). Not a very interesting method but doesn't require fancy shaders.<br><br>

            <p class="p2">

                I wanted to save some time and experiment with making more 'organic' shapes for the roof, so I made a
                base shape in maya for the roof coverage, as well as a roof tile model. Sent it over to Houdini and
                generated relaxed points on the surface, used a copytopoints node to duplicate the roof tile to the points (see video below). Converted
                it to voxels and applied some imperfections on it then outputing my highpoly file. Low poly was made
                by hand, as were the roof beams.<br><br>

                To take this a step further, should further variations be wished, I would argue for using
                something like a houdini SOP network to generate houses from boxes or curves - see below for an example of
                mesh generated using other meshes.

            <p class="p2">
                Adding more variations could markedly improve the look. The changes could probably be controlled by using houdini engine in
                Unity/Unreal (I have
                not tried to expose this functionality yet) to allow the designer to pick different wall variations by using a switch node, or directly in houdini
                for different parts of the wall (a wall could be a window, damaged wall or other types, it
                could also be randomized using a few rules plus a seed).
                <br><br><br>
                As for the wall textures I see two alternatives to my current solution:<br>
                <ul class="ul-margin"><br>
                    <li>Use a shader with two different tilable materials, as well as a mask to define intersections. This would
                        have
                        been more fun to use and allow for more unique setups. since I don't know the
                        limitations of mobile hardware enough I decided against it.</li><br>
                    <li>Model imperfections and stick them on surfaces of the wall where seen fit. The upside is that
                        there
                        would be less wasted texture space, the downside that it would look the same as it currently does
                        or possibly slightly worse.</li>
                </ul>
            </p><br>
            <b><center>Roof</center></b><br>
            <p class="p2">
                A better option would have been to generate curves along the base roof mesh (see image below) to
                place tiles along for the high poly version as described by
                <a href="https://80.lv/articles/procedural-house-production/" target="_blank">Øyvind Fiksdal</a>.
                My current solution used random scattering with a bit of relaxation on the points to prevent too
                many overlaps, while Fiksdals solution would allow the panes to be placed realistically.<br><br>
                Another option to make the solution a bit more cohesive and give designers more control would be to
                use modular systems similar to that of the walls, downside being that this would be more stiff and would not
                allow for more 'fun' shapes.

            <p class="p2">
                Lastly the roof could have used some some moss to feel more alive. I could have added this by scattering points on
                the mesh
                using either painted mask or detect crevices in the high poly mesh and using a perlin noise to
                further
                subract and create decent looking patterns for placements, below you can see a quick mockup of how that could be done.

            As mentioned earlier the weakness I recognize in my capabilities is clearly that I have limited experience with
            modern
            texturing solutions such as substance painter/designer, and no experience with 3ds Max
            which I am
            aware
            you use in your workflow. What I can already offer while I get up to speed and learn to use these tools effectively, is a skillset
            that is more technical. I might be able to assist other artists by improving the pipeline. I've
            made a
            few tools to deal with both pipeline improvements (for level design) and asset management (batch
            renaming and moving files for example) and I have some knowledge of materials/shaders.
